# DEEL BACKEND TASK

ðŸ’« Welcome Folks! ðŸŽ‰

This frontned exercise involves building a very simple Frontend (ReactJS) app that will demonstrate a communication with my REST API. The application has been specially simplified to a minimum. There is no routing, no global state and much more.

## Getting Set Up

Vite requires Node.js version 18+. 20+. However, some templates require a higher Node.js version to work, please upgrade if your package manager warns about it.

1. Install dependencies - In the repo root directory, run `yarn`

2. Then run `yarn dev` which should start the React client.
